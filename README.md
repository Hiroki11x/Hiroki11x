### About

Hi! I'm Hiroki Naganuma, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/) and [Mila - Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/), advised by Prof. [Ioannis Mitliagkas](http://mitliagkas.github.io/). 

My background includes high-performance computing and distributed deep learning, particularly for training large language models (LLMs).
I'm interested in semi-synchronous approaches, the challenges of large batch training, and efficient optimization algorithms.
Early in my Ph.D., I conducted extensive benchmarks on out-of-distribution generalization and confidence calibration.
Additionally, I have analyzed the optimization dynamics of generative adversarial networks and am currently exploring efficient fine-tuning techniques and fairness considerations in LLMs.

Most recently, I completed a research internship at Meta Superintelligence Lab (MSL) (Menlo Park), working with Dr. [Hao-Jun Michael Shi](https://hjmshi.github.io/) and Dr. [Parameswaran Raman](https://paramsraman.github.io/) on large-batch training and optimization.
Prior to that, I was a Student Researcher at [Google DeepMind (Mountain View)](https://deepmind.google/), where I worked with Dr. [George E. Dahl](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~gdahl/) on learning rate scheduling, and I also interned at [Microsoft Research (Redmond)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/about-microsoft-research/) with Dr. [Philipp Witte](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/pwitte/) and Dr. [Russell J. Hewett](https://www.rjh.io/) on efficient pretraining algorithms for large language models.

I am a recipient of the [Masason Foundation](https://masason-foundation.org/en/) Fellowship.
I earned my B.Sc. (2017) and M.Sc. (2019) from the [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english) as Valedictorian, where I worked closely with Prof. [Rio Yokota](https://www.rio.gsic.titech.ac.jp/en/member/yokota.html) and collaborators.

I expect to complete my PhD in Spring/Summer 2026 and am currently exploring both postdoctoral and industry research opportunities. Please feel free to reach out if you see a potential fit.
