### About

Hi! I'm Hiroki Naganuma, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at [UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al](https://www.umontreal.ca/) and [Mila - Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/), advised by Prof. [Ioannis Mitliagkas](http://mitliagkas.github.io/).
My research focuses on large-scale parallelization in machine learning and the analysis of training dynamics in deep neural networks. I recently completed student researcher role at [Google DeepMind (Mountain View)](https://deepmind.google/), where I worked under the guidance of Dr. [George E. Dahl](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~gdahl/) on learning rate scheduling.
Previously, I completed a summer internship at [Microsoft Research (Redmond)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/about-microsoft-research/), where I worked on efficient pretraining algorithms for large language models with Dr. [Philipp Witte](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/pwitte/) and Dr. [Russell J. Hewett](https://www.rjh.io/).
In the summer of 2025, I will be a research intern at [Meta - AI and Systems Co-Design (Menlo Park)](https://aisystemcodesign.github.io/) (host: Dr. [Hao-Jun Michael Shi](https://hjmshi.github.io/) and Dr. [Parameswaran Raman](https://paramsraman.github.io/)).

I am a recipient of the [Masason Foundation](https://masason-foundation.org/en/) Fellowship. I earned my B.Sc. (2017) and M.Sc. (2019) from the Tokyo Institute of Technology as Valedictorian, where I had the privilege of working closely with Prof. [Rio Yokota](https://www.rio.gsic.titech.ac.jp/en/member/yokota.html) and an outstanding group of collaborators.
